.DESCRIPTION
    Create a portable module. Portable modules are like regular modules, except for one difference 
    – they don’t contain any functionality. Each portable module reflects a regular PowerShell module, 
    in that it contains the cmdlet stubs of all the cmdlets of its regular PowerShell module counterpart. 
.STEPS
    STEP1
        Logon to a server that has the SMA PowerShell module installed (available on the Orchestrator installation media)
    STEP2
        create a PowerShell remoting session to the server that has the module installed
    STEP3
        execute the New-SMAPortableModule cmdlet provinding a source and destination path
    STEP4
        import the zip file into WAP
.NOTES
    You can remote into the server that has the SMA PowerShell module installed, but be aware of the double Hop.
    As kerberos uses delegation, the SMA server is not authenticated to remote into the server that has the target module installed.
    Using CredSSP as the authentication mechanism resolved this issue (but needs to be used wisely).
